# Ideas/To-do
- [ ] probably save a read of the site at the time and reread from it
  - [ ] not to cache (memory) and to a file instead?
- [ ] ability to visit the page
  - [ ] use opera if possible?
  - [ ] reset update notification on visit?
- [x] read website links from a text file
- [ ] ~~probably tkinter and not flask~~
  - [x] or maybe electron
  - [ ] ~~with typescript if doable?~~
- [ ] ability to set time between updates
  - [ ] probably something between 30mins to 12-24 hours?
  - [ ] button to manually get content before timer
- [ ] maybe a service, minimized version as well?
- [x] names: update-checker, not-rss, web-update-checker
